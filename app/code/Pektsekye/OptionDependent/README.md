### To export options

**2)** Click the "Export Product Custom Options" button. 
**3)** Find product_options.csv file in your browser downloads directory  

### To import options

**1)** Prepare options data with the Excel program:  
Required fields are five:  
*"product_sku", "option_title", "type", "value_title" (when type is "drop_down", "radio", "checkbox" or "multiple"), "row_id"*  
Valid option types are:  
*"field", "area", "file", "drop_down", "radio", "checkbox", "multiple", "date", "date_time", "time"* 
Valid price types are:  
*"fixed", "percent"* 

The "**row_id**" field should contain any unique per product number.  
This number will be used in the children field to reference an option or an option value.  

The "**children**" field contains comma separated "row_ids" of the product.  

Sample import file:
```csv
"product_sku","option_title","type","is_require","option_sort_order","max_characters","file_extension","image_size_x","image_size_y","value_title","price","price_type","sku","value_sort_order","row_id","children"
"24-MB04","Gender","drop_down","1","0","","","","","Mens","","","","0","2","4,5"
"24-MB04","Gender","drop_down","1","0","","","","","Womens","","","","1","3","6,7"
"24-MB04","Size","drop_down","1","1","","","","","S","","","","2","4",""
